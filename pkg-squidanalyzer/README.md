# SquidAnalyzer Unofficial packages for pfSense software

As many people knows, Netgate has trimed a lot of packages from official repo since pfSenseÂ® 2.3. 

This repo updates some packages for newer pfSense software versions with manual procedure installs.

This is not supported by Netgate or pfSense team. Use it at your own risk.

Feedbacks and contributions are always welcome.

The SquidAnalyzer package will create graphical reports to squid/e2guardian proxy access.log

# Install instructions

If you enabled the Unofficial repo, you can add this package under System -> Package Manager

Once it finishes, all must be in place. If you do not see the menu after it finishes, try to install any pfSense package from GUI, like cron for example.
